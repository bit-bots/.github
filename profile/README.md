## About us

Since 2012, we participate as a [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) soccer team in the [Humanoid League](https://humanoid.robocup.org/) research competition.

We are developing ROS 2 based software and our humanoid robot platform called [Wolgang](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352777711_Wolfgang-OP_A_Robust_Humanoid_Robot_Platform_for_Research_and_Competitions) to play autonomous 4 vs 4 soccer games.
All our software is open source and can be found on this GitHub profile, mainly in our [bitbots_meta repository](https://github.com/bit-bots/bitbots_meta).
Our hardware is also freely availabele [here](https://github.com/bit-bots/bitbots_hardware/).
